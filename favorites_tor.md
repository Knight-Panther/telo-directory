## Section 2: User Flow Experience & Error Handling

### 2.1 Core User Flows

#### **Flow 1: Anonymous User Discovery**
```
Anonymous User Action → Authentication Gate → Success Path
👤 User clicks ❤️ on BusinessCard
     ↓
🚨 Toast: "Please register or log in to save favorites"
     ↓
🔗 Redirect to Login/Register modal
     ↓
✅ Post-login: Return to business page with heart filled
     ↓
🔢 Header counter updates (+1)
```

**Error Cases:**
- Login failure → Show specific error message
- Registration failure → Display validation errors
- Network timeout → "Connection error, please try again"

#### **Flow 2: First-Time Favoriting (Authenticated User)**
```
Authenticated User → API Call → Success Feedback
👤 User clicks 🤍 (empty heart)
     ↓
📡 API: POST /api/auth/favorites/toggle/:businessId
     ↓
💾 Backend: Add businessId to user.favorites array
     ↓
✅ Toast: "Business added to favorites!"
     ↓
❤️ Heart changes to filled state (immediate UI update)
     ↓
🔢 Header counter updates (+1)
```

**Error Cases:**
- API failure → Rollback UI state, show error toast
- Business not found → "Business no longer available"
- Server timeout → Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Network offline → Queue operation for when online

#### **Flow 3: Already Favorited Business**
```
User Action → Information Feedback → Navigation Option
👤 User clicks ❤️ (filled heart)
     ↓
⚠️ Toast: "Business already in your favorites! Go to Dashboard to manage."
     ↓
🔗 Toast action button: "View Favorites"
     ↓
❤️ Heart stays filled (no state change)
```

**Error Cases:**
- Dashboard navigation failure → Fall back to current page
- Favorites page load error → Show error state with retry

#### **Flow 4: Favorites Management Dashboard**
```
Navigation → Data Loading → Management Interface
👤 User: Dashboard → "My Favorites" OR Header → "Favorites (5)"
     ↓
📄 Navigate: /dashboard/favorites
     ↓
📊 Load: User favorites with business details
     ↓
📋 Display: Business cards + individual/bulk actions
     ↓
☑️ Selection: Checkbox system for bulk operations
     ↓
🗑️ Actions: "Delete Selected" or "Delete All"
     ↓
⚠️ Confirmation: "Are you sure?" modal
     ↓
✅ Execute: Update database + refresh list
```

**Error Cases:**
- Empty favorites → Friendly empty state with call-to-action
- Load failure → Error state with refresh button
- Delete operation failure → Specific error message + retry option
- Bulk operation timeout → Progress indicator + partial success handling

### 2.2 Advanced Error Scenarios

#### **Data Consistency Errors**
- **Orphaned Favorites**: Business deleted but still in user favorites
  - Solution: Clean removal + user notification
- **Duplicate Favorites**: Same business favorited multiple times
  - Prevention: Use MongoDB $addToSet operator
- **Sync Issues**: UI state differs from server state
  - Solution: Periodic sync + conflict resolution

#### **Performance Edge Cases**
- **Large Favorites List**: User has 1000+ favorites
  - Solution: Pagination + virtual scrolling
- **Slow Network**: Operations timeout on poor connections
  - Solution: Optimistic updates + retry logic
- **High Concurrency**: Multiple devices modifying favorites simultaneously
  - Solution: Proper conflict resolution + last-write-wins strategy

### 2.3 Accessibility & UX Considerations

#### **Keyboard Navigation**
- Tab order: Heart button → Business details → Next card
- Space/Enter: Toggle favorite state
- Escape: Close modals/cancel operations

#### **Screen Reader Support**
- ARIA labels: "Add Restaurant ABC to favorites"
- State announcements: "Business added to favorites"
- Error announcements: "Error: Please try again"

#### **Mobile Touch Interactions**
- Minimum 44px touch targets
- Swipe-to-delete on mobile favorites list
- Long-press for bulk selection
- Pull-to-refresh for favorites page
